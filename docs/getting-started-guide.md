# Getting started.
Hi and welcome to the training! 

This guide helps you to get up and running as efficiently as possible. It provides 
step-by-step instructions for getting you coding.

I hope you'll find the training useful.

### Installs
To build and run this project, you will require the following tools:

##### Java SDK
If you have not already done so, install the latest release of the Java SDK. We use the [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/)
release, since Oracle changed the licensing with the LTS 11 release, making it unavailable for commercial use without a
commercial license. OpenJDK releases remain all-purpose.

##### IDE
The preferred IDE for this project is [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Jetbrains provides a community
edition, which is available for free. It's fine if you prefer to use a different IDE, but then you are on your own.

##### SCM
We'll use [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) as our versioning tool. In addition, we recommend using a visualization
tool, such as [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/).  

##### Maven
[Maven 3.1.0 or above](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) is required to build the project.

### Tools and commands
- [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/) is available in the build. This does require that annotation processing is enabled.
