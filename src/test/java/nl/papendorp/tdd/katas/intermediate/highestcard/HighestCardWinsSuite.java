	/*
	 * Implement the simple card game of 'highest card wins'.
	 *
	 * Given two stacks of arbitrary but equal length it should determine the winner by comparing consecutive cards and
	 * - print the winner and the final score or tied at score
	 *
	 * Examples:
	 * 2,3,4 vs 3,2,5 should print "Player 2 wins 2 to 1"
	 * ace, queen vs 10, 2 should print "Player 1 wins 2 to 0
	 * 7 vs 7 should print "Players tied at 1"
	 *
	 * You are free to choose the representation of the cards and stacks
