	/*
	 * Develop an api that moves a rover around on a grid.
	 *
	 * You are given the initial starting point (x,y) of a rover and the direction (north,south,east,west) it is facing.
	 * The rover receives a character array of commands.
	 * Implement commands that move the rover (forward/backward).
	 * Implement commands that turn the rover (left/right).
	 * Implement wrapping from one edge of the grid to another. (planets are spheres after all)
	 * Implement obstacle detection before each move to a new square. If a given sequence of commands encounters an
	 * obstacle, the rover moves up to the last possible point and reports the obstacle.
